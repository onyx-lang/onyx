// Macros allow you to write reusable blocks of code, much like procedures. Macros
// are different in that they are expanded at the call site, and then symbol resolution
// occurs. This means that every time a macro is called, it is expanded at the call site,
// and then it uses the symbols from the current scope.

main :: (args: [] cstr) {
    // A macro in Onyx looks just like a procedure, just with the word "macro" in front of it.
    a_simple_macro :: macro () {
        println("This is a simple macro");
    }

    a_simple_macro();

    // The powerful thing about macros is that they can access variables from their enclosing scope.
    // For example, this macro prints the value of 'x'.
    print_x :: macro () {
        printf("x is {}\n", x);
    }

    {
        x := 10;
        print_x(); 
    }

    {
        x := "a message";
        print_x();
    }

    // Macros can take on two different forms depending on if they return a value or not.
    // Macros that return a value are called "expression macros". Expression macros behave
    // mostly just like inlined functions, with the addition that they can access variables
    // from the calling-site's scope. Below is a simple expression macro.

    add_x_y :: macro () -> i32 {
        return x + y;
    }

    {
        x := 10;
        y := 20;
        z := add_x_y();
        printf("x + y is {}\n", z);
    }

    // Macros that do not return a value are called "block macros". Block macros behave differently
    // from expression macros when it comes to "return" and "defer" statements. Block macros do not
    // flush deferred statements when they end. A return statement in a block macro behaves like a
    // return in the caller.

    block_macro :: macro () {
        defer println("Block macro's deferred print.");

        println("Block macro's print.");
    }

    block_macro_that_returns :: macro () {
        println("Returning...");
        return;
    }

    calls_block_macro :: () {
        block_macro();

        println("This would be doing some work.");

        block_macro_that_returns();
        println("This will never be printed");
    }

    calls_block_macro();


    // A powerful feature of Onyx that enables macros to be very useful is code blocks.
    // Code blocks allow you to capture code and treat it as a compile-time object that can
    // be passed around. To create a code blocks, simply put '[]' in front of the block
    // of code you want to capture. Notice that this uses '::' because this is a compile-time
    // value.
    simple_code :: [] {
        println("This is a code block!");
    }

    // You can then use the '#unquote' directive to place the code wherever you need it.
    // We can paste it 3 times for examples in
    #unquote simple_code;
    #unquote simple_code;
    #unquote simple_code;

    // Because simple_code is a compile-time value, it can be passed to procedures as so:
    triple :: ($body: Code) {
        println("Running 3 times!");
        #unquote body;
        #unquote body;
        #unquote body;
    }

    triple(simple_code);

    // Because macros just alias their parameter names to the values passed, you don't need the
    // compile-time parameter (the '$').
    triple_macro :: macro (body: Code) {
        println("Running 3 times in a macro!");
        #unquote body;
        #unquote body;
        #unquote body;
    }

    triple_macro(simple_code);

    // As another small shorthand, if a code block only contains one expression (like the code block above),
    // then you can write by wrapping the expression in [](...).
    triple_macro([](println("Short code block!")));

    // As yet another small piece of syntactic sugar, you can pass a code block to a macro or procedure in
    // the following way:

    cool_block :: macro (param: i32, body: Code) {
        local_variable := param * 2;
        #unquote body;
    }

    cool_block(10) {
        println(local_variable);
    }

    // Whenever there is a call at the statement level, the compiler will look one token ahead and see if there
    // is a '{'. If there is, then the compiler will parse the '{' as the start of a code block, and will pass that
    // code block as the last non-named argument to the function call. This allows you to write blocks of code that are
    // prefaced by a controlling macro, which enables you do whatever crazy things you can imagine. For example, you
    // could do something like `#pragma omp parallel for` in Onyx without relying on compiler magic.
    //
    //     parallel_for(iterable, thread_count=4) {
    //         println(it); // Will be automatically assigned from the called macro.
    //     }
