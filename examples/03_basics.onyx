// Now, lets go over the basic types and control flow mechanisms in Onyx.

use core

main :: () {
    // Here is a list of all the builtin types:
    //       void
    //       bool
    //         i8  u8     (signed vs unsigned variants)
    //        i16  u16
    //        i32  u32
    //        i64  u64
    //        f32  f64
    //     rawptr
    //        str
    //       cstr
    //      range
    //
    // If you look in core/builtin.onyx, you can see the definition for some
    // of these types in terms of other types. Let's look at some of those types.

    // A pointer in Onyx is written as ^<type>. This is read as 'a pointer to a <type>'.
    //
    // Here foo is an i32. The unary prefix ^ operator takes the address of a value.
    // The type of foo_ptr is ^i32, or a pointer to an i32. Another example of a pointer
    // is the cstr builtin. It is ^u8, which is what C would call a char*.
    //
    foo     := 10
    foo_ptr := ^foo

    core.printf("foo is {}\n", foo)
    core.printf("foo_ptr is {}\n", foo_ptr)


    // An important type to know before proceeding is the range type. When designing
    // the language, there were a couple places where the idea of a range as very
    // natural, such as for loop iteration, and making slices. The range type in
    // Onyx is simply defined as a structure with 3 members: low, high, and step.
    // A range represents values between low and high, including low but not including
    // high, with a certain step between them. For example a range with values 5, 25, 2,
    // represents the numbers 5, 7, 9, .. 21, 23. While you can use the range structure,
    // it is more common to use a range literal, which is written below. 'rng' represents
    // a range with a low of 5, a high of 25, and a step of 1. Currently there is no way
    // to specify the step in a range literal.
    rng := 5 .. 25
    core.print("rng is ")
    core.println(rng)

    // Onyx has 3 different array-like types:
    //  * Fixed-size arrays, written [N] <type>, where N is a compile time know integer.
    //  * Slices, written [] <type>.
    //  * Dynamic arrays, written [..] <type>.
    //
    // Fixed size arrays are not commonly used because of their limited flexibility.
    // They are commonly seen as struct members or local variables. Here is an example
    // of creating and using a fixed size array. This uses a for-loop which we have not
    // looked at yet, but the example should be self-explanatory.
    fixed_arr : [10] i32
    for i in 0 .. 10 {
        fixed_arr[i] = i * i
    }
    core.printf("fixed_arr[3] is {}\n", fixed_arr[3])

    // A quick thing to note about fixed size arrays is that they copy their contents
    // on assignment. In this example, another_arr declares space on the stack for 10
    // i32s just like fixed_arr did; However, unlike in C, when another_arr is assigned
    // to fixed_arr, the contents of fixed_arr are copied into another_arr by value. So,
    // even when fixed_arr[3] is changed, another_arr[3] is the same.
    another_arr : [10] i32
    another_arr = fixed_arr

    fixed_arr[3] = 1234

    core.printf("another_arr[3] is {}\n", another_arr[3])


    // Slices are a concept not unique to Onyx. They represent a pointer and a count,
    // which allows them to be passed around conveying multiple pieces of information.
    // To create a slice, you either need a pointer or a fixed size array. Simply, do
    // an array access with the type of the index being a range. This creates a slice.
    //
    // Think of this example as letting slice_arr be a sub-array of fixed_arr. When
    // the 3rd element of slice_arr is accessed, it corresponds to the 6th element
    // of fixed_arr. It is important to know that this does NOT make a copy of the
    // data. It simply points into the same memory as fixed_arr.
    slice_arr := fixed_arr[3 .. 9]
    core.printf("slice_arr[3] is {}\n", slice_arr[3])

    // Dynamic arrays are the most common arrays used in practice. They represent a
    // pointer, a count, and a capacity. The extra capacity field allows implementations
    // to know how many elements can fit into the space allocated for the array, and not
    // just how many elements are currently in the array. To facilitate using dynamic
    // arrays, there are many procedures in the core.array package. Take this example.
    dyn_arr : [..] i32
    Array.init(^dyn_arr)
    defer Array.free(^dyn_arr)

    for i in 0 .. 10 {
        Array.push(^dyn_arr, i * i * i)
    }

    core.printf("dyn_arr is {}\n", dyn_arr)



    // I think that's enough about types for now. Lets look at the ways to manage control
    // flow in an Onyx program.

    // An important things to know before looking at control flow are the different ways
    // Onyx allows you to create a block. Blocks are used by all methods of control flow
    // and can be declared in one of three ways:
    //      * { ... } - Curly braces surrounding a set of semi-colon delimited statements.
    //      * do ...  - The do keyword followed by one statement.
    //      * ---     - The empty block which has no statements, equivalent to {}.

    // Onyx has standard if statement semantics. Each if statement contains a condition,
    // followed by a block. For this reason if-elseif chains have to be written with an
    // elseif keyword. Otherwise, you would have to write 'else do if', which I find to
    // be very ugly to read and is technically different, more on that later.

    if_var := 5 * 2 + 3
    if if_var == 13 {
        core.print("if_var was 13\n")
        core.print("another statement here!\n")
    }
    elseif if_var == 14 do core.print("if_var was actually 14\n")
    else do core.print("if_var wasn't 13 or 14\n")

    // Ifs, as well as whiles and switch statements, can have an initialization statement.
    // This statement is run before the condition is checked, and can be used to declare
    // variables that are scoped to the blocks of the if statement and all else statements.

    if hidden_if_var := 6; hidden_if_var > 5 {
        core.print("hidden_if_var was greater than 5!\n")
    }

    // If you uncomment this line, you will get an error, since hidden_if_var is only accessible
    // inside the if's block.
    // print(hidden_if_var)


    // Onyx has the standard top-test while loop, whose syntax is very similar to an if
    // statement. The only unique thing about Onyx's while loops, is that they can have
    // an 'else' clause. If the body of the loop is never run, i.e. the condition was
    // false originally, then the else clause is used. Try changing the initial value
    // for i to be 11.

    while i := 0; i < 10 {
        core.printf("{} ", i)
        i += 1
    } else {
        core.print("The while loop never ran...")
    }

    core.print("\n")


    // Onyx also has the standard 'break' and 'continue' statement found in many other
    // imperative programming languages, but with a slight twist. It is not uncommon to
    // be in a nested loop and want to either completely break out of all of the loops,
    // or to skip to the next iteration of an outer loop. For this reason, Onyx allows
    // you to place as many 'break' or 'continue' statements in a row as you need to
    // break or continue the loop that you want to. Take this example.
    while i := 0; i < 10 {
        while j := 0; j < 10 {
            core.printf("{} {}\n", i, j)

            if i == 1 && j == 2 do break break
            j += 1
        }
        i += 1
    }
}
