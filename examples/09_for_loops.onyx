// Looping over data structures is a very common operation done in all programming
// practices. In fact, I'd argue 97% of all programming problems can be solved by
// putting information into an array and looping over it. For this reason, for loops
// in Onyx are extremely simple to use by design and should make programming very
// enjoyable. But I digress, let's look at some examples.



use core {package, *}

main :: (args: [] cstr) {
    // Currently, for loops can iterate over five kinds of data structures in Onyx in
    //      * Ranges
    //      * Fixed arrays
    //      * Slices
    //      * Dynamic arrays
    //      * Custom iterators

    // The syntax of for loops is very simple in
    // for ^? <iteration variable> in <iterator> <block>

    // For example, this will print out the numbers in the array literal:
    for i in u32.[ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ] {
        println(i);
    }
    print("\n\n");


    // You may have noticed the options caret (^) in the definition of the for loop
    // syntax. When a caret is placed before the iteration variable, the iteration
    // variable will be a *pointer* to the data inside the iterator. This is useful
    // for iterating over larger data structures that don't need to be copied for
    // every iteration, or when you want to modify the elements of the iterator, as
    // so:

    primes := u32.[ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 ];
    for ^prime in primes {
        *prime *= 2;
    }

    print("Doubled primes: ");
    println(primes);

    // There is also support for custom iterators using the built-in Iterator type.
    // You have to specify a next, close, and data member. The semantics are roughly
    // as follows:
    //
    //     1. next is called to get two values: the next iteration value, and a
    //        continuation flag. If the continuation flag is true, then the iteration
    //        will continue for another iteration. If the continuation flag is false
    //        the iteration immediately terminates and the iteration value will be
    //        ignored.
    //
    //     2. close is called whenever the for-loop exits in any manner (finished,
    //        break, return).

    {
        value: i32 = 10;

        //       This is pointer provided to the iterator structure.
        next :: (v: ^i32) -> (i32, bool) {
            defer *v -= 1;
            return *v, *v >= 0;
        }

        close :: (v: ^i32) {
            println("Closing the iterator.");
        }

        iterator: Iterator(i32) = .{ data = ^value, next = next, close = close };

        // Simply use the iterator.
        for v in iterator {
            println(v);
        }
    }
}
