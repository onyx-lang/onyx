Modules in Onyx
---------------

Modules are going to be the form of reusable code in Onyx. They should be a
self-contained (maybe dependent on other modules), collection of Onyx files
with a module.onyx in the root folder that loads all relevant files to the
module. Modules can then easily be included by loading the module.onyx file
of any module.

Things that need to be decided about modules:
    - How should modules be searched for in the filesystem?
    - How should javascript code in modules be easily maintained?
        Current solutions just copy the relevant javascript on build.

Things that need to be done in the compiler:
    - Rename 'package' to 'namespace'
        I think 'namespace' better reflects the way I think about 'packages'.
        I don't want it to feel too 'C++-y' but I think the nomenclature change is worthwhile.

        'package' was orginally inspired by Java, but there the folder structure must match
        the package structure. In Onyx, that is not the case because it allows for packages
        to be extended on without needing to modify the source of the original package.

    - Add relative file loads and relative #file_contents.
        If the string starts with './', it should be considered relative.
        This will make it easier for modules to include their files, regardless of
        how the project is set up.
