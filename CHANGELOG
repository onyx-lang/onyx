Release 0.1.9
--------------
February 19th 2024

This release has some interesting new features and general usability improvements.
It does have a couple rather LARGE syntax changes that will affect nearly every program
written in Onyx. The two major syntax changes:

    For loops:
        for x in array             instead of        for x: array

    Cases with captures:
        case Value as capture      instead of        case capture: Value 

    Interfaces:
        X :: interface (T: type_expr) {
            t as T;
        }

        instead of

        X :: interface (t: $T) { ... }

These syntax changes help improve readability and makes the language more friendly to newcomers.
These changes also introduce two new keywords into the language that could see use in other places
in the future. This is a small improvement to make, but it is better to make it now while a
(relatively) small amount of Onyx code has been written.

Additions:
- OVM-Wasm support on MacOS (thanks to @judah-caruso).
    - This enables debugging support when on MacOS.
    - Available from installer.
- `.*` as a postfix alternative to `*`.
- `where` clauses can contain arbitrary boolean expressions (thanks to @judah-caruso).
- Small arrays (4 or fewer elements) have special accessors for their components.
- Tree-shaking is performed prior to code generation, reducing binary size drastically in some cases.
- Operation overloads for `+`, `-` and `*` for small arrays.
- `where defer` as a cleaner alternative to `where #bottom_test`
- `core.intrinsics.wasm.memory_equal`
- `core.iter.counter`
- `core.iter.sum`
- `core.iter.fold1`
- `make(List(T))`
- `core.list.from_array`
- `core.list.pop_begin_opt`
- `core.list.pop_end_opt`
- `core.list.empty`
- `core.conv.parse`
- `core.conv.parse_with_allocator`
- `core.encoding.json.encode_string_opt`
- `core.encoding.json.as_any` overload

Removals:
- Compiler test cases are no longer shipped with toolchain.

Changes:
- Due to tree shaking, the `methods` member of `Type_Info_Struct` and `Type_Info_Union` is not populated by default anymore.
    - Use the `--generate-method-info` CLI flag to add this information back in.
- Due to `as` being a keyword now, `cptr.as` was renamed to `cptr.as_unsafe`.

Bugfixes:
- Error reporting in many cases saw a lot of improvements.
    - Especially with polymorphic procedures, l-values, and code blocks.
- Implementation of `core.array.remove`.

      to a client for visualizations and debugging.
- New installation script
    - sh <(curl https://get.onyxlang.io -sSfL)
    - Works on Linux and MacOS
- KDL document parsing support

Removals:

Changes:
- Simplified using union variants of type `void`.
    - Now instead of `.{ Foo = .{} }`, use `.Foo` instead.
- Renamed `--no-std` flag to `--no-core`, since Onyx does not call its standard
  library "std", the name did not make any sense.
- `net.make_ipv4_address` now has a reasonable definition using a string for the IP,
  instead of an integer.

Bugfixes:
- Formatting of days and months were incorrect `time.strftime`.
- Infinite loop in TCP server when a client disconnects.



Release v0.1.7
--------------
October 25th, 2023

Additions:
- Support for WASIX, a new, extended standard to WASI, popularized by Wasmer.
    - Define `WASIX` in `runtime.vars` to enable it. (`-DWASIX` on the CLI)
    - Adds support for networking, futexes, and TTY control in WASI.

    - Only for OVM-wasm and Linux, for now.
- Scoped values in interfaces. `X :: ...` is allowed in an interface now.
- `#inject` works on interfaces.
- Polling to the `io.Stream` functionality.
    - Used to query when data is read/write-able from a stream, for supported streams.

Removals:

Changes:
- Complete overhaul of networking in the core library.
    - Backwards compatiblity was not strictly maintained, but common functions did
      not change, like `socket_send` and `socket_recv`.
- When debugging, `/ 0` or `% 0` will trigger an exception to debug the error.

Bugfixes:
- `alloc.atomic` package was broken when `sync` package was missing.
- `X.foo` would not work if `X` was a pointer to a union.
- Captures by pointer would break if the value was a primitive whose address wasn't
  taken anywhere else.
- Symbol name reported by documentation generation was incorrect for some methods.



Release v0.1.6
-----------
24th September 2023

Additions:
- Tagging global variables.
    - Just like procedure and structure tags.
    - Use `runtime.info.tagged_globals` and `runtime.info.get_globals_with_tag()`

- `Date.day_of_week()`

Removals:

Changes:
- `misc.any_to_map` now returns `? Map(str, any)`.
- Build scripts on Linux no longer internally use `sudo`, requiring the script to be run with `sudo` instead.
    - This makes it possible to easily build Onyx into a container image.
- Parse errors with an unexpected symbol now say the symbol's name instead of TOKEN_TYPE_SYMBOL.

Bugfixes:
- `alloc.arena.clear` would not leave the arena in a proper state for further allocations.
- `array.filter` was implemented incorrectly.
- `runtime.platform.__get_env` was implemented incorrectly on Onyx runtime.
- `Result.is_ok` and `Result.is_err` were implemented with incorrect return types.

    - `union #tag_type u8`
- Infrastructure to have custom sub-commands.
    - Any `*.wasm` file in `$ONYX_PATH/tools` is available to run with `onyx <cmd>`
- `__futex_wait` and `__futex_wake` to platform layer.
    - This allows for non-busy-waiting on mutexes and semaphores.
    - Currently implemented for Onyx and JS platforms; WASI is impossible, but WASIX will come soon.
- `--skip-native` flag to `onyx pkg sync` to skip compiling native libraries.
- Ability to tag methods on structures.
- `tty_get` and `tty_set` functions in `core.os`

    - Currently only for `onyx` runtime and on Linux only.
- `-Dno_entrypoint` for programs that do not have a `main` function.

Removals:
- `Wait_Notify_Available` global in `runtime` package.
    - This is no longer needed as futexes are preferred instead of wait/notify.

Changes:

Bugfixes:
- Fixed bug in `json.encode` that caused arrays of structures to not be outputted correctly.
- Fixed bug in `onyx pkg` that caused `onyx pkg new` to not work as intended.



Release v0.1.4
-----------
22nd June 2023

Additions:

Removals:
- Deprecated `map.get_opt`.
    - This is unnecessary with the new semantics of `map.get`.

Changes:
- `onyx pkg` now stores synchronized packages in a different folder hierarchy.
    - This is a transparent change so long as you use the `lib/packages.onyx` file.
- `Map` implementation no longer holds a default value. Instead, it returns an optional from `map.get`.
    - This is a significant breaking change that will affect many programs.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug that made relative imports not always relative to the current file.
    - This may break some programs that were accidentally using this "feature".
- Fixed a bug with small a `union` over small data types, such as booleans.
    - There was an alignment issue, which caused the union to be smaller than expected.


Release v0.1.3
-----------
19th June 2023

Additions:
- New syntax for declaring quoted code blocks.
    - `[captures] { body }` for blocks.
    - `[captures] ( expr )` for expressions.

    - Used in assertions and heap allocator for better error reporting
- `Optional.with` for running a block of code with the value in an Optional, if one is present.
- `-Dvariable=value` command line option to add symbols to the `runtime.vars` package.
- `--no-type-info` command line option to omit type information from the binary.
- `Allocator.move`. Moves a value into an allocator, returning a pointer to it.
    - This is a copy operation (and might be renamed later)
- `core.encoding.hex` package
    - Quickly convert a byte array to and from its hex equivalent.
- `os.path_clean`
- `os.path_directory`
- `os.path_extension`
- `os.path_split`
- `slice.equal`
- `iter.find`
- `iter.flatten`

Removals:

    - Switch to `[] {}` and `[] ()` respectively.
- Old WASI specific modules for time and environment variables.
- `Result.return_err` and `Result.return_ok`.
    - Unnecessary with new union features.

Changes:
- Much faster backend (approximate 1.3-1.4x speedup for most programs)
- Added support for optionals in `json.encode`, `json.from_any`, and `json.as_any`.
- Added support for optionals in `conv.parse_any`.
- `Set` implementation no longer contains a "default value". Instead, an optional is returned from `get`.
    - A similar thing may happen to `Map` soon, but that is a significant breaking change.
- Indexing for union tag types starts at 0 now, instead of 1.
    - There were many annoyances where Zero-Is-Initialization (ZII) was not followed and
      that was causing too many bugs to be worth it.

Bugfixes:
- Numerous bugs related to polymorphic procedures


Release v0.1.2
-----------
30th May 2023

Additions:

Removals:

Changes:
* `Optional` is now a tagged-union
* `Result` is now a tagged-union

    iterator, with the single value yielded.
* `io.write_escaped_str` supports escaping "\\" now.
* In Javascript runtime, made `__read_from_input` not defined right away, so
    it can be overridden depending on the needs of the program.

Bugfixes:
* `json` encoder was wrongly not encoding strings when using `encode` on an `any`.



Release v0.1.1a
-----------
15th May 2023

Additions:

Removals:

Changes:
* Javascript now supports time at the platform layer.
    - Expects import "host.time"

Bugfixes:
* Fixed javascript runtime not compiling due to missing dependency on `core.os`.


Release v0.1.1
-----------

Additions:
* Ability to have tags on `#foreign` block procedures.
    - This will enable the creation different binding generators, such jsbindgen.

Removals:

Changes:
* Undefined function imports in `onyx run` no longer cause an immediate error.
    - Instead, an error is produced when the function is called.
* API for time remains the same, but reduced dependencies on external time things,
    like strftime, localtime and mktime.
* Ergnomic improvements to `onyx pkg`.

Release v0.1.0
--------------
This release contains MANY CHANGES because I am terrible at keeping up to date with a
proper changelog and release schedule. Basically, this is the first release where I
feel like the language is at a good place. Many "gotcha" bugs have been resolved and
the language is much more powerful now for it. There are still plenty of things that
are going to be changed and added in the future, but first I want to get this better
version out there in a packaged format.

Additions:
* Multi-threading for the JS backend (--use-multi-threading)
* Running Onyx directly from the compiler using 'onyx run'
    - This internally links with libwasmer to provide the WASM runtime.
* threading primitives (mutex, semaphore, etc.)
* atomic intrinsics
* Quick-Functions
* do-expressions
* typeof
* interfaces and where clauses
* '#auto' return type
* Macros and paste-able code blocks
* overloaded procedures can have polymorphic and overloaded procedures as overloads.  This makes them MUCH more powerful.
* types are not required on struct members that have default values. This is still very experimental so there are some
    noticable bugs with it. You can always specify the type explicitly if you have issues.
* structure definitions act like name spaces and can have top-level expressions defined within them, such as procedures
    or other structures.
* structures can be "used" to bring in the aforementioned top-level expressions into the current scope.
* experimental method call syntax using ->.
* compound declarations for procedure locals and struct members that are of the same type.
* custom iterators using the builtin structure, Iterator(T). This the semantics will be written out elsewhere but long
    story short, you can have custom iterators using the language's 'for' statement.
* '--print-function-mappings' to see where a wasm function comes from in the source text.
* logging allocator. Wraps any allocator and prints what kind of allocations are happening.
* many math functions.
* basics of reading environment variables
* Relative file inclusion using "./" at the start of the path

Removals:
* the "proc" keyword.

Changes:
* initialization statements on if/while/switch are a lot more powerful.
* operator overloading is now done as a top level declaration handled through the entity
    system, instead of relying on creating a procedure. This lets you use an existing
    procedure as an operator overload. Take a look at '#operator ==' in string.onyx.
* easier to write types in expressions
* Tons of internal code cleanup relating to structures and code generation.

Bug fixes:
* Too many more to even start listing them all.


Release v0.0.6
--------------
Additions:
* Compilation on Windows. All you should need is `cl.exe` in the current environment,
    and then simply run `build.bat`. I haven't thoroughly tested this, but I believe
    it will work on many systems. ARM / PowerPC may not work correctly.
* procedures can be polymorphic on an array size.
* structures can be polymorphic on any compile-time known value.
* procedures can be polymorphic on any compile-time known value, including type expressions.
* basics of operator overloading using `#operator +`.
* multiple return values and multiple assignment / declarations.
* #solidify directive for explicitly specifying type variables in polymorphic procs.
* properly different kinds of allocators in core/alloc/.
* `null_proc` in builtin.onyx type matches against all procedure types, allowing for a
    'null' procedure.
* '-VV' and '-VVV' for very verbose printing. Easier to nail down compiler issues because it stops
    printing in the entity where the problem is.
* `io.Stream` API with `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`.
* ranges on switch cases, i.e. `case 4 .. 10`. Note, this is inclusive on the upper end,
    unlike most other uses of the range literal.
* miscellaneous core library functions

Removals:
* struct literals can no longer specify values for members brought in through a `use`.
* Makefile; just use ./build.sh or ./build.bat

Changes:
* `::` declarations in a procedure are treated differently now. They used to represent a constant
    value, but one that was still computed at the assignment site. Now, they instead are used to
    declare top level expressions in the procedure scope. This means that things like structs and
    enums can be declared at any block scope. The top-level expressions currently do not have
    access to polymorphic variables in the procedure.
* `#include_file` is now `#load` and `#include_folder` is now `#load_path`. I like the shorter names.
* enum values are compile time known.
* struct literals are compile time known can be used at top level scope.
* range literals are proper things in the compiler code now.
* polymorphic procedure generation code is much cleaner now, making new polymorphic features easier.
* procedures can be part of top-level struct literals.
* `raw_alloc` and `raw_resize` take alignment arguments, with defaults provided.

Bug fixes:
* polymorphic procedures would get 'confused' when two structs in the program had the same name.
* function argument type mismatch would give wrong function name.
* `structs` with `use`d members caused all sorts of problems.
* bug fix with field access of unknown type causing infinite loop.
* auto-cast in overloaded function call resulted in no match found, even though there was one.
* struct member defaults were processed too early in the pipeline, causing errors.
* assignment of array type with array literal optimization.
* probably many more since everything is compiled with warnings now.
* deferred statements are correctly executed with break, continue and fallthrough.
* `0..10` was not parsed correctly.


Release v0.0.5
--------------
Additions:
* array literals; use (type).[ (vals) ] as the syntax; They work as global variables, and
    local variables, and as intermediates (such as function arguments).
* polymorphic procedures can be instantiated in many more places now due to clean up.
* added #context_scope block. It automatically stores and restores the context at the beginning
    and the end of the block respectively.
* 'use' statements work on pointers to structures.
* '--fun' flag displays a bar graph of where each of the entities in the compilation
    pipeline are. Compiles the program slower purely to make it look better.
* --verbose prints statistics about the compilation including time taken, lines
    processed and token processed.
* 'abs' function in core/math.onyx.
* 'read_word' in core.string.reader.
* Better error reporting for invaild binary operators.

Removals:
* field accesses on things that are not lvals. This was a bug anyway, so it
    should not require any code changes, but the feature is gone.
* i32map, strmap, ptrmap modules. Use generic map in map.onyx instead.

Changes:
* BREAKING: The type name 'string', and the package name 'str', have been swapped.
* 'use' statements are more powerful. 'use package' can occur at any scope level,
    and 'use <value>' can occur at file scope.
* struct literals can now have arbitrary package prefixes on them, i.e.
    some.deeply.nested.packages.Struct.{ ... };
* struct literals can have arbitrary expressions as their type, i.e.
    (#type [] void).{ ... };
* cleaned up CLI
* assignment over an array type copies the array instead of just the pointer.

Bug fixes:
* globals that were #foreign caused several bugs, which have been squashed.
* field accesses can only happen on lvals.
* Bitwise NOT on unsigned integers did not work.
* 'use' statements now work in polymorphic procedures
* resizing heap allocated memory at the end of memory would not grow underlying memory.
* stack position variables introduced from for loops, ifs, whiles, or switchs would produce
    very bad side effects if they were not in a stack based function.
* array.remove was broken when the semantics of `for: lo .. hi` changed.


Release v0.0.4
--------------
Additions:
* Ability to pass complicated structs by value. Very useful in polymorphic data types.
* bitwise not operator, ~
* auto cast operator, ~~. In many circumstances, will automatically determine what to cast to.
    - Will also report errors in the cast is not possible.
* Arbitrarily typed varargs. They behave similar to C-style varargs.
* vararg_get builtin procedure to retrieve a value from a ... vararg.
* #local directive for placing a symbol at file scope.
* a basic implentation of printf in the standard library.
* use statements at the function level.
* nested packages, i.e. 'core.array'
    - Still testing it out; could change at in the future
* basic printf implementation
* core.str.reader library

Removals:

Changes:
* Massive renaming of packages, since nested packages are now allowed.
    - Most collections of function simply were put into a package, instead of being prefixed,
        i.e. array_map -> array.map
* Numeric literals now no longer have a concrete type; they become whatever type is needed,
    reporting an error if that is not possible.
* Procedure definitions now require parentheses, even if there are no arguments. This was
    done to allow for `proc { foo, bar }` to be the overload syntax.
* array.map takes an arbitrary parameter of polymorphic type to make up for the fact that
    anonymous procs do not have closure. New type signature is:
        array_map :: proc (arr: ^[..] $T, data: $R, f: proc (T, R) -> T)
* better syntax highlighting for VIM.
* Compiler internals changed to make it easier to do advanced things in the future. 

Bug fixes:
* many bugs related to var args and procedure calls in general.
* polymorphic structs caused segmentation fault when trying to produce an error message.
* polymorhpic structs caused scope to change when using a struct literal of a polymorphic type.
* #char "\"" did not work.
* nested function calls returning non-basic types would simply be wrong.
* Recursive structs are no longer possible.
* For loop array/slice/dynarray used to use signed indicies, which was wrong.



Release v0.0.3
--------------
Additions:
* Added polymorphic structs.
* Added polymorphic structs to polymorphic pattern matching.
* Added I32Map polymorphic structure to core library.
* Added println to core library; print followed by a newline.
* Added tests/ folder and runtests.sh which will compile and execute the programs in the
    folder and test against their expected output.
* #local for specifying symbols at the file scope.

Removals:

Changes:
* BREAKING: 'use package' now places included symbols at the file scope, not package scope.
* Switched to using TCC as the primary compiler, while maintaining support for GCC.
* boolean literals are compile time known so they can be used at top level.
* #file_contents now results in [] u8, not *u8.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed error message index for struct literal member type mismatch.
* Added struct member name in struct literal member type mismatch.
* Fixed freeing non-allocated memory when generating documentation.
* Fixed alignment issue with struct members.
