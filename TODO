Bugfix:
- [ ] Empty `union` breaks many things
- [ ] Switching with negative numbers breaks things

Standard library:
- [ ] Networking support on Windows
- [ ] Thread parallelism
- [ ] Support raw strings in KDL parser and encoder
- [x] XML Parser

Language ideas:
- [ ] Interface check is a compile-time constant.

Tangential items:
- [ ] Create "worksheets" that serve as an intro to the language
    - Like Zig's Ziglings

Other libraries:
- [ ] WIT to Onyx code generator
- [ ] C header to Onyx code gen
    - Somewhat working for Sqlite3 library



Complete:
- [x] `where` is for any compile-time constant.

- [x] .{ ..copy_from, member = value }
    Copies from `copy_from`, then changes member values.

- [x] Network resolve
- [x] Redo process spawning API

- [x] json `as_any` support for `? T`
    - If not present, do 'None'.
    - Otherwise, parse and fill the value.

- [x] Remove `Result.return_ok` and `Result.return_err`
    - Unnecessary with new union type.


- [x] Code blocks can have and accept captures

- [x] Tagged Unions
    - [x] Parse them
    - [x] Check them
    - [x] Type construct them
    - [x] Polymorphism
    - [x] Wasm codegen
    - [x] Switch statement
    - [x] Type Info
    - [x] Format string them
    - [x] Debug type info
    - [x] Doc gen

- [x] #tag works on global variables

- [x] Choose tag backing type of unions

- [x] Platform layer has network code

- [x] Expand network code capabilities

- [x] WASIX Support
    - [x] Networking
    - [x] Futexes
    - [x] TTY

- [x] Create package index on Onyx website
- [x] Upgrade Wasmer version to 4.2.x
- [x] Make install script for Onyx (sh <(curl https://get.onyxlang.io -sSfL))
    - [x] Works on Linux for sure
    - [x] Maybe on Mac??
    - Definitely not windows
- [x] General support for MacOS
    - [x] Basics are compiling
    - [x] Wasmer integration
    - [x] Runtime layer
    - [x] Package manager
